# Dogs vs Cats Image Classification

The **"Dogs vs Cats Image Classification"** project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning for automated image processing and offers a user-friendly interface for instant classification.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/do-martin/Dogs-vs-Cats-Image-Classification.git
   cd Dogs-vs-Cats-Image-Classification

2. Install the required packages: You can use pip to install the required libraries. It's recommended to create a virtual environment first:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the code.

## Required Libraries
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- ZipFile
- OS
- Warnings
- Random

You can find the specific library versions in the `requirements.txt` file.
