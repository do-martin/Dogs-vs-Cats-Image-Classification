# Dogs vs Cats Image Classification

The **"Dogs vs Cats Image Classification"** project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning for automated image processing and offers a user-friendly interface for instant classification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/do-martin/Dogs-vs-Cats-Image-Classification.git
   cd Dogs-vs-Cats-Image-Classification

### Install Required Packages

It is recommended to create a virtual environment first:

```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to explore and run the code.

## Sample Images for Evaluation

To facilitate the evaluation of the model's performance, please create a folder named `Bilder_dogs_cats_test`. In this folder, you should include various images of dogs and cats. These images are intended solely for evaluating the model's accuracy and should not be used during the training phase.

### Guidelines for Sample Images

- The images should be in JPEG or PNG format.
- Ensure that each image name is unique to avoid any confusion.
- Use these images exclusively for evaluation purposes and not for training the model.

## Required Libraries

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Additional libraries used include:
- ZipFile
- OS
- Warnings
- Random

You can find the specific library versions in the `requirements.txt` file.
